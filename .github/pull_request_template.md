<!--# Pull request template

Complete the following steps before you submit a PR.

## Upload a new tutorial to the repo

1. You made changes in a separate "feature" branch (for example, `feat/seo-astro`)
2. You named the project following the pattern `topic-tech`
3. You placed the project in the correct directory
4. You updated the cloning instructions in the project's `README` (use [this file](https://github.com/storyblok/tutorials/tree/main/build/geo-astro#1-clone-this-project-from-the-repository) as a template)
5. You added the project to the list of tutorials in the main `README` file

> [!TIP]
> If you're writing a series of tutorials that use the same codebase, create numbered sub-directories (for example, `multilingual-astro-01`).
